# Public Home Page Implementation

## Overview
A public home page has been created for the insurance application that displays available policies and provides navigation to login/signup pages.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Public Home Component (`/frontend/src/app/components/home/`)
- **home.component.ts**: Angular component with policy fetching logic
- **home.component.html**: Modern, responsive UI with:
  - Navigation header with login/signup links
  - Hero section with call-to-action buttons
  - Features section highlighting benefits
  - Policies listing with cards
  - Call-to-action section
  - Footer with links
- **home.component.css**: Custom styling and animations

### 2. Updated Routing (`/frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts`)
- Set home page as default route (`/`)
- Added `/home` route as alternative
- Updated fallback route to redirect to home instead of login

### 3. Backend API Endpoints (`/backend/src/server.js`)
- **GET `/public/policies`**: Public endpoint to fetch all policies (no authentication required)
- **POST `/public/seed-policies`**: Endpoint to seed sample policies for testing

### 4. Updated Policy Service (`/frontend/src/app/services/policy.service.ts`)
- Added `getPublicPolicies()` method for fetching policies without authentication

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 2. Seed Sample Policies (Optional)
To populate the database with sample policies, make a POST request to:
```
POST http://localhost:4000/public/seed-policies
```

### 3. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
ng serve
```

### 4. Access the Application
- Open `http://localhost:4200` - You'll see the public home page
- Click "Login" or "Sign Up" buttons to navigate to authentication pages
- Browse available insurance policies on the home page

## Features of the Public Home Page

### Navigation
- Clean header with logo and login/signup buttons
- Responsive design that works on all devices

### Hero Section
- Compelling headline and description
- Call-to-action buttons leading to login/signup

### Features Section
- Three key benefits: 24/7 Support, Affordable Premiums, Fast Claims
- Icons and descriptions highlighting company strengths

### Policies Section
- Dynamic loading of policies from backend
- Policy cards showing:
  - Policy image (if available)
  - Title and code
  - Description
  - Premium, term, and coverage details
  - "Get Quote" and "Apply Now" buttons

### Call-to-Action Section
- Final push for user registration
- Links to signup and login pages

### Footer
- Company information and quick links
- Contact details

## Technical Details

### Frontend
- Built with Angular standalone components
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Loading states and error handling
- Observable-based data fetching

### Backend
- Express.js REST API endpoint
- MongoDB integration for policy storage
- No authentication required for public policies
- Error handling and logging

### Data Flow
1. Home component loads on page visit
2. Component calls `PolicyService.getPublicPolicies()`
3. Service makes HTTP request to `/public/policies`
4. Backend queries MongoDB for all policies
5. Policies are returned and displayed in cards
6. Users can click login/signup buttons to navigate to auth pages

## Customization

### Adding New Policies
Use the admin panel to create new policies, or use the seed endpoint to add sample data.

### Styling
Modify `home.component.css` for custom styling, or update the Tailwind classes in the HTML template.

### Content
Update the hero section, features, and footer content in `home.component.html` to match your brand.

## Security Considerations
- Public endpoint doesn't require authentication
- Only basic policy information is exposed (no sensitive data)
- Admin functions remain protected behind authentication
